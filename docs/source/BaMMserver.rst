*De novo* Motif Discovery
.........................
.. _De novo Motif Discovery:

We developed a new and fast method called **PEnG!motif** for searching motifs (position specific weight matrices,
PWMs) in a set of nucleotide sequences (DNA or RNA). Based on the PWMs discovered by PEnG!motif, we train BaMMs
(Bayesian Markov Models) which take positional inter-dependencies into account and give us more information about
the motifs derived from the sequence set.

Input items
+++++++++++
.. _Input items:

**Job Name** (optional)

You can specify the job name.

By default, a random job ID is generated  so that you can easily search for it later on the "Find My Job" page.

**Input Sequences** (required)

Please enter a FASTA formatted file containing DNA sequences that are enriched for a motif which you want to predict
(i.e. peak sequences from ChIP-seq measurements). The sequences do not have to be of the same length. The maximum file
upload size is limited to 2.5 Mb.

You can choose to "Load Example Data" for testing.

**MMcompare Motif Database**

Databases containing trained BaMM models or PWM models from public available ChIP-seq datasets.

.. _Advanced_options:

Advanced Options
++++++++++++++++

**General settings**

*Search on both strands*

When checked, the reverse complementary sequences are used for motif search as well.

Select this option when motifs can occur on both strands. Transcription factors and micro RNAs can usually bind on
both strands (in reverse orientation). Deselect if you are searching for directional motifs.

*Background Sequences*

You can upload a FASTA file containing background sequences if available. It will be used for generating the background
model for motif learning and evaluation.

*Background Model Order*

The background model order *K* defines up to which order the background model will be learned. The background model is
a *K*-order homogeneous Markov model. The default *K* is 2, which means that the background model will be derived from
3-mer frequencies of the background sequences. We recommend a background model of 2 for a realistic model of the genomic
input. For very short motifs, a background model order of 1 or even 0 may be required to find the motif.

**Seeding stage**

*Pattern Length*

The length of patterns on the sequences to be searched.

*Z-Score Threshold*

Z-score threshold for basic patterns. Patterns with lower than this Z-score threshold will not be considered.

*Count Threshold*

Patterns with fewer than this amount of counts will be be considered.

*IUPAC Optimization Score*

Scoring function that is used for optimizing to the IUPAC patterns. There are three options:

* LOGPVAL: calculate optimization scores based on p-value on the log scale
* MUTUAL_INFO: calculate optimization scores based on the mutual information of patterns
* ENRICHMENT: calculate optimization scores based on expected pattern counts

*Skip EM*

When checked, the Expectation-Maximization (EM) step will be skipped for optimization.

**Model Settings**

*Model Order*

The model order *k* defines up to which order the BaMM will be optimized. A zeroth-order BaMM is equivalent to a PWM.
A first-order BaMM model takes dinucleotide probabilities into account. Registered users can learn models up to 8th-
order while anonymous users are limited to forth-order models (due to the computation time and resource).

*Flanking extension*

The extend options allow the user to add uniformly initialized positions to the left and/or right of the motif
initialization. The number corresponds to the amounts of nucleotide appended to both ends of the motif. If the
initializer only consists of the informative core motif, enlarging the motif allows to learn the information in the
flanking regions.

**Additional settings**

*Run motif scanning*

When checked, the input sequences will be scanned for occurrences of the optimized motif. It generates the motif
distribution plot on the results page.

*Motif scanning p-value cutoff*

Only motif positions with a p-value smaller than this cutoff will be reported as binding positions. The p-values
are computed by fitting the high-scoring tail of the log-odds score distribution on sequences generated with the
background model with an exponential function, which give good fits.

*Run motif evaluation*

When checked, the performance of the optimized motif on the input sequence set will be evaluated. It generates the
performance plots.

*Run motif-motif compare*

When checked, the optimized motifs will be compared with the motifs in the selected database.

*MMcompare e-value cutoff*

The e-value limit will be used to define a threshold for motif comparisons between the query model and the database.
